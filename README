njsdl - libSDL Java bindings
----------------------------

'njsdl' is a Java wrapper for the well known libSDL with pure
OpenGL3.x (without deprecated API) bindings and some additional
classes for easier OpenGL development.

Currently Win32(64) and Linux32 binaries are included.

This is a WIP release, stuff on the TODO list:
- Code clean ups (as usual)
- Complete JavaDoc (and generated JavaDoc)
- Implementation of some more SDL functions
- ...

Build instructions:
-------------------
To build the Jar simply use 'ant'. You'll find 'njsdl.jar'
inside of 'build/jar'.

To rebuild the binaries:
- On Linux 32 bit:
   'ant linux32_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant linux32'
- On Windows 32 bit:
   'ant win32_clean' to clean the native target
   'ant win32'
